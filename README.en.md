## Visualization

 - [Echarts](https://github.com/apache/echarts): Apache ECharts is a free, powerful charting and visualization library offering easy ways to add intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts to your commercial products. It is written in pure JavaScript and based on zrender, which is a whole new lightweight canvas library.
 - [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet): JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
 - [leaflet-echarts3](https://github.com/wandergis/leaflet-echarts3): A plugin for leaflet to load echarts3 map and Make big data visualization easier.
 - [deck.gl](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl): deck.gl is designed to simplify high-performance, WebGL-based visualization of large data sets. Users can quickly get impressive visual results with minimal effort by composing existing layers, or leverage deck.gl's extensible architecture to address custom needs.
 - [Mapv](https://github.com/huiyan-fe/mapv): Mapv is a library of geography visualization, it can be used to visualize the big data of point, polyeline and polygon, and it has a different ways, such as simple, heatmap, grid, time and others to display the datas. This is the prerelease of Mapv 2.0. This API is unstable and may change at any point prior to the release.
 - [heatmap.js](https://github.com/pa7/heatmap.js): JavaScript Library for HTML5 canvas based heatmaps

## WebGL
- [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/): An easy to use, lightweight, cross-browser, general purpose 3D library. The current builds only include a WebGL renderer but WebGPU (experimental), SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available as addons.
- [CesiumJS](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium): CesiumJS is an open source JavaScript library for creating world-class 3D globes and maps with the best possible performance, precision, visual quality, and ease of use. Developers across industries, from aerospace to smart cities to drones, use CesiumJS to create interactive web apps for sharing dynamic geospatial data.

## Organizations

- [usgif.org](http://www.usgif.org): The United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational foundation dedicated to promoting the geospatial intelligence tradecraft and developing a stronger GEOINT Community with government, industry, academia, professional organizations, and individuals who develop and apply geospatial intelligence to address national security challenges. USGIF achieves its mission through various programs and events and by building the community, advancing the tradecraft, and accelerating innovation.

## Publications

- [Trajectory](http://trajectorymagazine.com): *Trajectory* is the official publication of the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF)â€”the nonprofit, educational organization supporting the geospatial intelligence tradecraft. Trajectory  provides high-level thought leadership for USGIF Members as well as for the defense, intelligence, homeland security communities, and the global GEOINT Community. Trajectory is the preeminent resource on issues of significance to all geospatial intelligence stakeholders. Our promise is to provide relevant, actionable content in a format that is compelling and engaging. Our mission is to foster knowledge sharing, awareness, and discussion.
- [GEOINT](http://geoint2017.com/): Geospatial intelligence, or GEOINT, is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. GEOINT consists of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information.
